###Wings: a mod for Minetest
Wings is a mod that allows player to fly, upon crafting and using wings.

####What this mod does:
This mod provides three levels of wings, plain, bronze and gold, which each allow different lengths of flight for the player. To do this, the mod uses [Wuzzy's playereffects mod](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=9689).

####Configeration:
This mod can be configured through the config.lua file. Each option has a description of what it controls above it. I recommend checking through the file before you use the mod, just to check everything is okay for use with your game/server.

####Dependencies:
This mod only depends on the playereffects mod, with an optional dependency on default for the crafts.

####Todo:
- Add support for the [mana mod.](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=9&t=11154)
- Maybe try and make better textures. (If you can make them, please do!)

####Licenses:
Code and images are licensed under the WFTPL.
