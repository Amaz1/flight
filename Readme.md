##Flight: A modpack for Minetest
###Intro:
This modpack will be made up of two (Or possibly more) mods. One of them will be wings, and the other jetpacks.
Currently, just the wings mod is uploaded, jetpack has the code, but I need to make textures for it.
These mods do/will have a dependency on [Wuzzy's playereffects mod](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=9689)
All of the mods can be configured extensively through the config.lua file found in each mod.

Look at the readme's of the mods for more info.
