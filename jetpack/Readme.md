###Jetpack: a mod for Minetest
Jetpack is a mod that allows player to fly, upon crafting and using a jetpack!

####What this mod does:
This mod provides three levels of jetpacks, plain, bronze and gold, which each allow different lengths of flight for the player. To do this, the mod uses [Wuzzy's playereffects mod](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=9689).

####Configeration:
This mod can be configured through the config.lua file. Each option has a description of what it controls above it. I recommend checking through the file before you use the mod, just to check everything is okay for use with your game/server.

####Dependencies:
This mod only depends on the playereffects mod, with an optional dependency on default for the crafts.

####Todo:
- Nothing atm. (Support for the mana mod will **not** be added, seeing as jetpacks are mechanical.)
- Sugestions welcome!

####Licenses:
Code and images are licensed under the MIT license.
